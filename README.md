# War Card Game
## Rules of card game war are:
* Split deck of 52 cards between two users.
* Each player plays a card. Higher card wins. Winner takes both cards.
* If cards are of same rank, then each player puts down three cards, and the third card competes. If a player has less than 3 cards, then they put down all of their cards and their final card competes against the other player's third card. Continue doing this until tie is broken. Winner takes all cards.
* Game is over when a player doesn't have any cards. The player with cards remaining is the winner.
